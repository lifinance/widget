Remove Phantom from the Bitcoin wallet connectors. Phantom deprecated its Bitcoin wallet and removed the injected `window.phantom.bitcoin` provider, so it no longer connects for Bitcoin. The default Bitcoin config no longer registers the `phantom()` connector, and the `app.phantom.bitcoin` installed-wallet detection has been removed. Phantom for Solana/EVM is unaffected.
