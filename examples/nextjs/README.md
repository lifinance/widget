This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

> **_NOTE:_** If you are using Next 13 be sure to look at the examples in `examples/nextjs-page-router` 
> which have been written with Next.js 13 specifically in mind.

Examples can be seen on the following paths

- http://localhost:3000/ - the shows the use of \<ClientOnly \/\> to import and used the Widget in the App Router
- http://localhost:3000/pages-example - the shows the use of \<ClientOnly \/\> to import and used the Widget in the Pages Router
- http://localhost:3000/dynamic-import - the shows the use of `next/dynamic` API to import and use the Widget


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
