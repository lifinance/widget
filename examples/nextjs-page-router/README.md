This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

> **_NOTE:_** We maintain this example on Next 13 intentionally to demo some of the nuances of
> importing and using the Widget in the Pages and App router for Next.js 13. 
> Usage gets easier when using Next 14 - so if you are in a position to it is advisable 
> to use Next 14 rather than Next 13. See `examples/nextjs` example for Next 14 usage

Examples can be seen on the following paths

- http://localhost:3000/ - the shows the use of \<ClientOnly \/\> to import and used the Widget in the App Router
- http://localhost:3000/pages-example - the shows the use of \<ClientOnly \/\> to import and used the Widget in the Pages Router
- http://localhost:3000/dynamic-import - the shows the use of `next/dynamic` API to import and use the Widget

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
