### Migrating from Remix?
This example was a remix app converted to a react router 7 app.

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying node applications, the built-in React Router app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `react-router build`

- `build/`
- `public/build/`
